# Viewing Party
 framework/language badges

 Viewing party is an application in which users can explore movie options and create a viewing party event for the user and friend's.

 During these trying times that we face globally, it is important to find little joys and create memories. This is especially important as we search for new ways to connect to our friends and family in the new remote environment.
